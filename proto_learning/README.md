# Learning Discriminative Prototypes with Object Factorization

This code implements the prototype learning method proposed in POEM.

### Requirements
1. Requirements for Pytorch. We use Pytorch 1.2.0 in our experiments.
2. Requirements for Tensorflow. We only use the tensorboard for visualization.
3. You may need to install the OpenCV package (CV2) for Python.
