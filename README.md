# POEM: Bridging Known and Unknown with Prototypical Neural Modules

This repository implements the PrOtotypical nEural Module network. It contains three key components, stored in the following directories:
- vqa_exp: zero-shot VQA experiments on the VQA v2 and Novel-VQA datasets
- gqa_exp: zero-shot VQA experiments on the GQA dataset, and
- proto_learning: the code for our prototype learning method with object factorization.

Please refer to the README in each directory for details.
